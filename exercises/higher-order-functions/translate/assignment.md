# Assignment

Start with a quick peek at the given `Movie` class.

The `Imperative` class contains a number of methods
that performs queries on a list of `Movie`s written
in an imperative style. This exercise
asks of you to translate each of these queries
into functional style.

Make a copy of `Imperative.cs`, name it
`Functional.cs`. Modify it so that
the namespace is called `Functional` instead
of `Imperative`. Rewrite all methods one by one.
